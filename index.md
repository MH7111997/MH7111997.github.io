## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in the [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), advised by [Karthik C. S.](http://karthikcs.org/). My current interests are mainly in parameterized and fine-grained complexity.

Before coming to Rutgers, I was an undergraduate student in the [Computer Science & Engineering Department](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/).
